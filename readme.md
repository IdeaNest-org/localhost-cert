# Localhost Cert

## A convenient, secure, and developer-friendly method to enable HTTPS support for localhost during development.

### What is My Certificate Helper?

My Certificate Helper is an NPM package that provides a simple and convenient way to enable HTTPS support for your local development server. It includes a set of tools and utilities to generate a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate specifically for localhost, and to configure your development server to use this certificate.

### How does it work?

My Certificate Helper works by providing a set of functions that you can use in your Node.js application to generate and install a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate for your local development server. It also includes a command-line interface that you can use to perform the same tasks from the terminal.

### What are the key features?

- Generates a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate specifically for localhost
- Configures your development server to use the generated certificate
- Provides a command-line interface for easy installation and configuration
- Works with most popular development servers, including Node.js, Apache, and Nginx
- Secure and developer-friendly

### How do I use it?

To use My Certificate Helper in your Node.js application, simply install it using NPM:

```bash
npm install my-certificate-helper --save-dev
```

Then, require the package in your code and use the provided functions to generate and install the SSL/TLS certificate:

```javascript
const myCertificateHelper = require('my-certificate-helper');

// Generate and install the SSL/TLS certificate
myCertificateHelper.installCert();
```

Alternatively, you can use the command-line interface to perform the same tasks:

```bash
my-certificate-helper install
```

### Is it secure?

Yes, My Certificate Helper uses industry-standard SSL/TLS encryption to secure your local development server. However, please note that self-signed certificates are not suitable for production environments as they are not issued by a trusted authority. In production, you should obtain a valid SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted certificate authority.
